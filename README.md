# Movie-Data-Analysis
This project only uses Python language, as we are looking for a relation between the various features.

Data was collected from `Kaggle`. Dataset contains three decades of movie data (1986-2016), scraped from IMDb using Python. There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016).

Dataset : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)


Code: [Movie Data Analysis](https://github.com/sitharavpk/Movie-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Movie%20Data%20Correlation%20Project.ipynb)

This project provides a detailed understanding about how to explore the data to compute the correlation between the attributes.
